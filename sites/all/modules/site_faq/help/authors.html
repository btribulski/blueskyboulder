<h2>How Pages Reflect &quot;Submitted By&quot;</h2>
<p><strong>Question: </strong>I have updated a page but the &quot;Submitted by&quot; information shows the orginal person that posted the page/story.</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>The site did reflect that you did edits, but it is under   the posting's &quot;<em><strong>Revisions</strong></em>&quot; tab. The&nbsp;&quot;<em><strong>Submitted by</strong></em>&quot; area that shows up on the&nbsp;site by   default holds the name of the original author of&nbsp;a posting. So if you make&nbsp;edits   to an existing story it still holds the orginal author's   info.</p>
<p>If you need to change this for&nbsp;any reason there is an area   toward the bottom of&nbsp;a page's&nbsp;&quot;<em><strong>Edit</strong></em>&quot; screen called &quot;<em><strong>Authoring information</strong></em>&quot;.   Click the link to expand that area and you can update the&nbsp;author and publishing   date&nbsp;for&nbsp;the posting.</p>
