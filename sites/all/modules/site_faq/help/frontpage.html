<p>Adding content to the frontpage of the site is fairly easy. Currently the Frontpage is set to show &quot;promoted&quot; <em><strong>News Stories</strong></em> and <em><strong>Events</strong></em>. </p>
<h3><strong>What is the difference between a News Story and an Event?</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>A <em><strong>News Story</strong></em> is just a simple article/announcement about whatever you wish.</li>
  <li>An <em><strong>Event</strong></em> should be used when there is a specific date associated with an announcement. An <em><strong>Event</strong></em> can have the textual detail of a article but will also automatically show up in the web site's Event Calendar. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
  <li>From the Left Hand Menu Select - <em><strong>Create Content</strong></em></li>
  <li>Select either <em><strong>News Story</strong></em> or <em><strong>Event</strong></em></li>
  <li>Fill in the <em><strong>Title/Event Name, Date(s), and Body/Description</strong></em></li>
  <li>If you select <em><strong>Committees</strong></em> and have the <em><strong>Public</strong></em> box <em>unchecked</em> this item will only appear on the front page for a logged in user that is a member of that committee. If you leave the default settings everyone can view the information.</li>
  <li>In the Publishing options (at the bottom of the page) make sure <strong><em>Published</em></strong> and <em><strong>Promoted to the front page</strong></em> are selected (they are by default)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Helpful Tip:</strong> If you ever want to keep and item published on the site but not appear on the frontpage just uncheck <em><strong>Promoted to the front page</strong></em> when editing a <em><strong>News Story</strong></em> or <em><strong>Event</strong></em></p>
